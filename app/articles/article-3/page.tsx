            Article III creates the <strong>federal judiciary</strong> as the third co-equal branch of government. It 
            establishes the Supreme Court, authorizes Congress to create lower federal courts, protects judicial 
            independence through lifetime tenure and salary protection, defines federal court jurisdiction, and 
            establishes constitutional protections for treason trials.

              Federal judicial power belongs to the Supreme Court and whatever lower federal courts Congress chooses to 
              create. Federal judges serve for life (during "good behavior") and their salaries cannot be reduced while 
              they serve. These protections ensure judicial independence from political pressure.

              tyranny, and maintaining rule of law. Judges need not fear losing their jobs or pay for unpopular but 
              legally correct decisions.

              "Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their 
              Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two 
              Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court. The Congress shall have Power to declare

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Treason is narrowly defined as either waging war against the United States or giving aid and comfort to its 
              enemies. To convict someone of treason requires either two witnesses to the same overt act or a confession 
              in open court. Congress sets the punishment, but treason convictions cannot result in "corruption of blood" 
              (punishing the traitor's family) or forfeiture of property beyond the convicted person's lifetime.

            <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mb-2">
              The Framers intentionally defined treason narrowly and set a high burden of proof because in England, 
              treason was broadly defined and used to silence political opponents. The Constitution's narrow definition 
              protects:

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-sm text-gray-700 ml-2 space-y-1">
              <li><strong>Political dissent</strong> — Can't charge opponents with treason for disagreement</li>
              <li><strong>Free speech</strong> — Words alone generally insufficient for treason</li>
              <li><strong>Fair trials</strong> — Two-witness requirement prevents false accusations</li>
              <li><strong>Individual accountability</strong> — No punishing families for one person's acts</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-sm text-gray-700 mt-2">
              This reflects the Founders' experience with arbitrary accusations of treason by the British Crown.

            <p className="text-sm text-gray-700">
              <strong>Modern Approach:</strong> Because treason's constitutional definition is so narrow and requires such 
              high proof, federal prosecutors typically charge national security violations under other statutes like 
              espionage (18 U.S.C. § 793), providing aid to terrorists, or conspiracy. These have lower burdens of proof 
              and avoid constitutional treason requirements.

            Article III establishes an independent federal judiciary with the Supreme Court at its apex and lower courts 
            created by Congress. Judicial independence is protected through lifetime tenure and salary guarantees, ensuring 
            judges can decide cases based on law without political pressure.

          <p className="leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Federal courts have jurisdiction over cases involving the Constitution, federal laws, treaties, and certain 
            party-based disputes. The "case or controversy" requirement limits courts to deciding actual disputes with 
            concrete stakes, not abstract legal questions.
