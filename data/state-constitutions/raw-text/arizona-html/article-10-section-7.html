      <P>      Section 7.  A.  A separate permanent fund shall be established for each
      of the several objects for which the said grants are made and confirmed by the
      enabling act to the state, and whenever any monies shall be in any manner
      derived from any of said lands, the same shall be deposited by the state
      treasurer in the permanent fund corresponding to the grant under which the
      particular land producing such monies was, by the enabling act, conveyed or
      confirmed.</P>
      <P>      B.  No monies shall ever be taken from one permanent fund for deposit in
      any other, or for any object other than that for which the land producing the
      same was granted or confirmed. </P>
      <P>      C.  All such monies shall be invested in safe interest-bearing
      securities and prudent equity securities consistent with the requirements of
      this section.</P>
      <P>      D.  The legislature shall establish a board of investment to serve as
      trustees of the permanent funds.  The board shall provide for the management
      of the assets of the funds consistent with the following conditions:</P>
      <P>      1.  Not more than sixty percent of a fund at cost may be invested in
      equities at any time.</P>
      <P>      2.  Equities that are eligible for purchase are restricted to stocks
      listed on any national stock exchange or eligible for trading through the
      United States national association of securities dealers automated quotation
      system, or successor institutions, except as may be prohibited by general
      criteria or by a restriction on investment in a specific security adopted
      pursuant to this subsection.</P>
      <P>      3.  Not more than five percent of all of the funds combined at cost may
      be invested in equity securities issued by the same institution, agency or
      corporation, other than securities issued as direct obligations of and fully
      guaranteed by the United States government.</P>
      <P>      E.  In making investments under this section the state treasurer and
      trustees shall exercise the judgment and care under the prevailing
      circumstances that an institutional investor of ordinary prudence, discretion
      and intelligence exercises in managing large investments entrusted to it, not
      in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of
      monies, considering the probable safety of capital as well as the probable
      total rate of return over extended periods of time.</P>
      <P>      F.  The earnings, interest, dividends and realized capital gains and
      losses from investment of a permanent fund, shall be credited to that fund.</P>
      <P>      G.  The board of investment shall determine the amount of the annual
      distributions required by this section and allocate distributions pursuant to
      law.  The annual distribution from the permanent funds:</P>
      <P>      1.  For fiscal years 2012-2013 through 2014-2015, shall be two and
      one-half percent of the average monthly market values of the fund for the
      immediately preceding five calendar years.</P>
      <P>      2.  For fiscal years 2015-2016 through 2024-2025, shall be six and
      nine-tenths percent of the average monthly market values of the fund for the
      immediately preceding five calendar years, except that in fiscal year
      2015-2016, the distribution made from the permanent state school fund shall be
      $259,266,200.</P>
      <P>      3.  Beginning with fiscal year 2025-2026, shall be two and one-half
      percent of the average monthly market values of the fund for the immediately
      preceding five calendar years.</P>
      <P>      H.  For fiscal years 2015-2016 through 2024-2025, any increase in
      expendable earnings under section 37-521, subsection B, paragraph 4, Arizona
      Revised Statutes, that results from a distribution of more than two and
      one-half percent of the average monthly market values of the fund for the
      immediately preceding five calendar years pursuant to subsection G, paragraph
      2 of this section shall be appropriated for basic state aid, including
      inflation adjustments required by section 15-901.01, Arizona Revised Statutes.</P>
      <P>      I.  On or before February 1 of each year, if the average monthly market
      values of the fund for the immediately preceding five calendar years have
      decreased compared to the average monthly market values of the fund for the
      five-calendar-year period that immediately precedes the preceding five
      calendar years, the director of the office of strategic planning and
      budgeting, or its successor agency, and the director of the joint legislative
      budget committee, or its successor agency, shall jointly notify the governor,
      the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives
      that a reduction to the distribution prescribed in subsection G, paragraph 2
      of this section is necessary to preserve the safety of the capital in the
      fund. On receipt of that notification, the legislature may enact legislation,
      with the approval of the governor, that reduces the distribution in subsection
      G, paragraph 2 of this section for the next fiscal year to at least two and
      one-half percent but less than six and nine-tenths percent of the average
      monthly market values of the fund for the immediately preceding five calendar
      years.</P>
      <P>      J.  Any amount reduced pursuant to subsection I of this section is not
      required to be paid or distributed:</P>
      <P>      1.  From any other source of public monies.</P>
      <P>      2.  In any subsequent fiscal year.</P>
      <P>      K.  If the legislature enacts legislation, with the approval of the
      governor, that reduces the distribution pursuant to subsection I of this
      section:</P>
      <P>      1.  The legislature may reduce the base level for the next fiscal year
      by an amount commensurate with the reduction in the distribution from the
      permanent state school fund for the next fiscal year.</P>
      <P>      2.  The amounts from the base level reduction are not required to be
      paid or distributed in any subsequent fiscal year.</P>
      <P>      3.  The base level reduction is not part of the calculation of the base
      level for subsequent fiscal years.</P>
      <P>      L.  This section preserves the authority vested in the legislature
      pursuant to this constitution.</P>
      <P>      M.  This section and article XI, section 11 of this Constitution and the
      terms and appropriations of house bill 2001, fifty second legislature, first
      special session, fully satisfy the requirements of section 15-901.01, Arizona
      Revised Statutes. </P>
