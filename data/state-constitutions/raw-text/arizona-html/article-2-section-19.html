      that tend to establish the guilt of any other person or corporation charged
      with bribery or illegal rebating, shall not be excused from giving testimony
      or producing evidence, when legally called upon to do so, on the ground that
      it may tend to incriminate him under the laws of the state; but no person
      shall be prosecuted or subject to any penalty or forfeiture for, or on account
      of, any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he may so testify or
      produce evidence. </P>
