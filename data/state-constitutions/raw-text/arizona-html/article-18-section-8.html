                  <P> 8.  <font color=PURPLE><u>Workmen's compensation law</P>
      <P>      </u></font>Section 8.  The legislature shall enact a workmen's compensation
      law applicable to workmen engaged in manual or mechanical labor in all public
      employment whether of the state, or any political subdivision or municipality
      thereof as may be defined by law and in such private employments as the
      legislature may prescribe by which compensation shall be required to be paid
      to any such workman, in case of his injury and to his dependents, as defined
      by law, in case of his death, by his employer, if in the course of such
      employment personal injury to or death of any such workman from any accident
      arising out of and in the course of, such employment, is caused in whole, or
      in part, or is contributed to, by a necessary risk or danger of such
      employment, or a necessary risk or danger inherent in the nature thereof, or
      by failure of such employer, or any of his or its agents or employee or
      employees to exercise due care, or to comply with any law affecting such
      employment; provided that it shall be optional with any employee engaged in
      any such private employment to settle for such compensation, or to retain the
      right to sue said employer or any person employed by said employer, acting in
      the scope of his employment, as provided by this Constitution; and, provided
      further, in order to assure and make certain a just and humane compensation
      law in the state of Arizona, for the relief and protection of such workmen,
      their widows, children or dependents, as defined by law, from the burdensome,
      expensive and litigious remedies for injuries to or death of such workmen, now
      existing in the state of Arizona, and producing uncertain and unequal
      compensation therefor, such employee, engaged in such private employment, may
      exercise the option to settle for compensation by failing to reject the
      provisions of such workmen's compensation law prior to the injury, except that
      if the injury is the result of an act done by the employer or a person
      employed by the employer knowingly and purposely with the direct object of
      injuring another, and the act indicates a wilful disregard of the life, limb
      or bodily safety of employees, then such employee may, after the injury,
      exercise the option to accept compensation or to retain the right to sue the
      person who injured him.</P>
      <P>      The percentages and amounts of compensation provided in house bill no.
      227 enacted by the seventh legislature of the state of Arizona, shall never be
      reduced nor any industry included within the provision of said house bill no.
      227 eliminated except by initiated or referred measure as provided by this
      Constitution. </P>
