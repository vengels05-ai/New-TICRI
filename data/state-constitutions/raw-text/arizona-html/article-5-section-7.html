                  <P> 7.  <font color=PURPLE><u>Presentation of bills to governor; approval;
                  veto; filing with secretary of state; veto of items in
                  appropriation bills; inapplication of veto power to referred
                  bills</P>
      <P>      </u></font>Section 7.  Every bill passed by the legislature, before it
      becomes a law, shall be presented to the governor.  If he approve, he shall
      sign it, and it shall become a law as provided in this constitution.  But if
      he disapprove, he shall return it, with his objections, to the house in which
      it originated, which shall enter the objections at large on the journal. If
      after reconsideration it again passes both houses by an aye and nay vote on
      roll call of two-thirds of the members elected to each house, it shall become
      a law as provided in this constitution, notwithstanding the governor's
      objections.  This section shall not apply to emergency measures as referred to
      in section 1 of the article on the legislative department.</P>
      <P>      If any bill be not returned within five days after it shall have been
      presented to the governor (Sunday excepted) such bill shall become a law in
      like manner as if he had signed it, unless the legislature by its final
      adjournment prevents its return, in which case it shall be filed with his
      objections in the office of the secretary of state within ten days after such
      adjournment (Sundays excepted) or become a law as provided in this
      constitution.  After the final action by the governor, or following the
      adoption of a bill notwithstanding his objection, it shall be filed with the
      secretary of state.</P>
      <P>      If any bill presented to the governor contains several items of
      appropriations of money, he may object to one or more of such items, while
      approving other portions of the bill.  In such case he shall append to the
      bill at the time of signing it, a statement of the item or items which he
      declines to approve, together with his reasons therefor, and such item or
      items shall not take effect unless passed over the governor's objections as in
      this section provided.</P>
      <P>      The veto power of the governor shall not extend to any bill passed by
      the legislature and referred to the people for adoption or rejection. </P>
