      <P>      </u></font>Section 8.  When the State is admitted into the Union, and the
      superior courts, in their respective counties, are organized, the books,
      records, papers, and proceedings of the probate court in each county, and all
      causes and matters of administration pending therein, shall pass into the
      jurisdiction and possession of the superior court of the same county created
      by this Constitution, and the said court shall proceed to final judgment or
      decree, order, or other determination, in the several matters and causes with
      like effect as the probate court might have done if this Constitution had not
      been adopted. </P>
