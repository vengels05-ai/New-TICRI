      office, and upon qualifying therefor, the office formerly held shall become
      vacant.  No justice or judge of any court of record shall practice law during
      his continuance in office, nor shall he hold any office in a political party
      or actively take part in any political campaign other than his own for his

      papers for an elective office, other than for judge of the superior court or a
      court of record inferior to the superior court in a county having a population
      of less than two hundred fifty thousand persons according to the most recent
      United States census, forfeits his judicial office. </P>
