      provide for different times or periods of registration between and within the
      several classes of vehicles.</P>

      reduced as provided by law.</P>
      <P>      From and after December 31, 1973, mobile homes, as defined by law for
      tax purposes, shall not be subject to the license tax imposed under the
      provisions of this section but shall be subject to ad valorem property taxes
      on any mobile homes in the manner provided by law.  Distribution of the
      proceeds derived from such tax shall be as provided by law.</P>
      <P>      From and after December 31, 1973, the legislature shall provide for the
      distribution of the proceeds from such license tax to the state, counties,
      school districts, cities and towns. </P>
