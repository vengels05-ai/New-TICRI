                   congressional elections.</P>
      <P>      </u></font>Section 18.  The name of any candidate for United States senator
      from Arizona shall not appear on the ballot if, by the end of the current term
      of office, the candidate will have served (or, but for resignation, would have
      served) in that office for two consecutive terms, and the name of a candidate
      for United States representative from Arizona shall not appear on the ballot
      if, by the end of the current term of office, the candidate will have served
      (or, but for resignation, would have served) in that office for three
      consecutive terms.  Terms are considered consecutive unless they are at least
      one full term apart.  Any person appointed or elected to fill a vacancy in the
      United States congress who serves at least one half of a term of office shall
      be considered to have served a term in that office for purposes of this
      section.  For purposes of this section, terms beginning before January 1, 1993
      shall not be considered. </P>
