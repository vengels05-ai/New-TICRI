                   <P> 20.  <font color=PURPLE><u>Retirement and service of retired justices and
                   judges</P>
      <P>      </u></font>Section 20.  The legislature shall prescribe by law a plan of
      retirement for justices and judges of courts of record, including the basis
      and amount of retirement pay, and requiring except as provided in section 35
      of this article, that justices and judges of courts of record be retired upon
      reaching the age of seventy.  Any retired justice or judge of any court of
      record who is drawing retirement pay may serve as a justice or judge of any
      court.  When serving outside his county of residence, any such retired justice
      or judge shall receive his necessary traveling and subsistence expenses.  A
      retired judge who is temporarily called back to the active duties of a judge
      is entitled to receive the same compensation and expenses as other like active
      judges less any amount received for such period in retirement benefits. </P>
