      <P>      Section 23.  A.  An initiative or referendum measure that proposes a
      mandatory expenditure of state revenues for any purpose, establishes a fund
      for any specific purpose or allocates funding for any specific purpose must
      also provide for an increased source of revenues sufficient to cover the
      entire immediate and future costs of the proposal. The increased revenues may
      not be derived from the state general fund or reduce or cause a reduction in
      general fund revenues.</P>
      <P>      B.  If the identified revenue source provided pursuant to subsection A
      in any fiscal year fails to fund the entire mandated expenditure for that
      fiscal year, the legislature may reduce the expenditure of state revenues for
      that purpose in that fiscal year to the amount of funding supplied by the
      identified revenue source.<font color=BLUE> </font></P>
