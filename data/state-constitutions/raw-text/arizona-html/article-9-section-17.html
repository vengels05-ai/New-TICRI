                   <P> 17.  <font color=PURPLE><u> Economic estimates commission; appropriation
                   limitation; powers and duties of commission</P>
      <P>      </u></font>Section 17.  (1)  The economic estimates commission shall be
      established by law, with a membership of not to exceed three members, and
      shall determine and publish prior to February 1 of each year the estimated
      total personal income for the following fiscal year.  By April 1 of each year
      the commission shall determine and publish a final estimate of the total
      personal income for the following fiscal year, which estimate shall be used in
      computing the appropriations limit for the legislature.  For the purposes of
      this section, &quot;total personal income&quot; means the dollar amount that will be
      reported as total income by persons for the state of Arizona by the U. S.
      department of commerce or its successor agency.</P>
      <P>      (2)  For purposes of this section, &quot;state revenues&quot;:</P>
      <P>      (a)  Include all monies, revenues, fees, fines, penalties, funds,
      tuitions, property and receipts of any kind whatsoever received by or for the
      account of the state or any of its agencies, departments, offices, boards,
      commissions, authorities, councils and insitutions except as provided in this
      subsection.</P>
      <P>      (b)  Do not include:</P>
      <P>      (i)  Any amounts or property received from the issuance or incurrence of
      bonds or other lawful long-term obligations issued or incurred for a specific
      purpose.  For the purpose of this subdivision long-term obligations shall not
      include warrants issued in the ordinary course of operation or registered for
      payment by the state.</P>
      <P>      (ii)  Any amounts or property received as payment of dividends or
      interest.</P>
      <P>      (iii)  Any amounts or property received by the state in the capacity of
      trustee, custodian or agent.</P>
      <P>      (iv)  Any amounts received from employers for deposit in the
      unemployment compensation fund or any successor fund.</P>
      <P>      (v)  Any amounts collected by the state for distribution to counties,
      cities and towns without specific restrictions on the use of the funds other
      than the restrictions included in section 14 of this article.</P>
      <P>      (vi)  Any amounts received as grants, aid, contributions or gifts of any
      type, except voluntary contributions or other contributions received directly
      or indirectly in lieu of taxes.</P>
      <P>      (vii)  Any amounts received as the proceeds from the sale, lease or
      redemption  of property or as consideration for services or the use of
      property.</P>
      <P>      (viii)  Any amounts received pursuant to a transfer during a fiscal year
      from another agency, department, office, board, commission, authority, council
      or institution of the state which were included as state revenues for such
      fiscal year or which are excluded from state revenue under other provisions of
      this subsection.</P>
      <P>      (ix)  Any amounts attributable to an increase in the rates of tax
      subsequent to July 1, 1979 on vehicle users, gasoline and diesel fuel which
      were levied on July 1, 1979.</P>
      <P>      (x)  Any amounts received during a fiscal year as refunds,
      reimbursements or other recoveries of amounts appropriated which were applied
      against the appropriation limitation for such fiscal year or which were
      excluded from state revenues under other provisions of this subsection.</P>
      <P>      (3)  The legislature shall not appropriate for any fiscal year state
      revenues in excess of seven per cent of the total personal income of the state
      for that fiscal year as determined by the economic estimates commission. The
      limitation may be exceeded upon affirmative vote of two-thirds of the
      membership of each house of the legislature on each measure that appropriates
      amounts in excess of the limitation.  If the legislature authorizes a specific
      dollar amount of appropriation for more than one fiscal year, for the purpose
      of measuring such appropriation against the appropriation limitation, the
      entire amount appropriated shall be applied against the limitation in the
      first fiscal year during which any expenditures are authorized, and in no
      other fiscal year.</P>
      <P>      (4)  In order to permit the transference of governmental functions or
      funding responsibilities between the federal and state governments and between
      the state government and its political subdivisions without abridging the
      purpose of this section to limit state appropriations to a percentage of total
      personal income, the legislature shall provide for adjustments of the
      appropriation percentage limitation consistent with the following principles:</P>
      <P>      (a)  If the federal government assumes all or any part of the cost of
      providing a governmental function which the state previously funded in whole
      or in part, the appropriation limitation shall be commensurately decreased.</P>
      <P>      (b)  If the federal government requires the state to assume all or any
      part of the cost of providing a governmental function the appropriation
      limitation shall be commensurately increased.</P>
      <P>      (c)  If the state assumes all or any part of the cost of providing a
      governmental function and the state requires the political subdivision, which
      previously funded all or any part of the cost of the function to
      commensurately decrease its tax revenues, the appropriation percentage
      limitation shall be commensurately increased.</P>
      <P>      (d)  If a political subdivision assumes all or any part of the cost of
      providing a governmental function previously funded in whole or in part by the
      state, the appropriation percentage limitation shall be commensurately
      decreased.</P>
      <P>      Any adjustments made pursuant to this subsection shall be made for the
      first fiscal year of the assumption of the cost.  Such adjustment shall remain
      in effect for each subsequent fiscal year. </P>
