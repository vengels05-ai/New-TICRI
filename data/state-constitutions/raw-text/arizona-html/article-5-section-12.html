                  <P> 12.  <font color=PURPLE><u>Compensation of elective state officers;
                  commission on salaries for elective state officers</P>
      <P>      </u></font>Section 12.  The salaries of those holding elective state
      offices shall be as established by law from time to time, subject to the
      limitations of article 6, section 33 and to the limitations of article 4, part
      2, section 17. Such salaries as are presently established may be altered from
      time to time by the  procedure established in this section or as otherwise
      provided by law, except that legislative salaries may be altered only by the
      procedures established in this section.</P>
      <P>      A commission to be known as the commission on salaries for elective
      state officers is authorized to be established by the legislature.  The
      commission shall be composed of five members appointed from private life, two
      of whom shall be appointed by the governor and one each by the president of
      the senate, the speaker of the house of representatives, and the chief
      justice.  At such times as may be directed by the legislature, the commission
      shall report to the governor with recommendations concerning the rates of pay
      of elected state officers.  The governor shall upon the receipt of such report
      make recommendations to the legislature with respect to the exact rates of pay
      which he deems advisable for those offices and positions other than for the
      rates of pay of members of the legislature.  Such recommendations shall become
      effective at a time established by the legislature after the transmission of
      the recommendation of the governor without aid of further legislative action
      unless, within such period of time, there has been enacted into law a statute
      which establishes rates of pay other than those proposed by the governor, or
      unless either house of the legislature specifically disapproves all or part of
      the governor's recommendation.  The recommendations of the governor, unless
      disapproved or altered within the time provided by law, shall be effective;
      and any 1971 recommendations shall be effective as to all offices on the first
      Monday in January of 1973.  In case of either a legislative enactment or
      disapproval by either house, the recommendations shall be effective only
      insofar as not altered or disapproved.  The recommendations of the commission
      as to legislative salaries shall be certified by it to the secretary of state
      and the secretary of state shall submit to the qualified electors at the next
      regular general election the question, &quot;Shall the recommendations of the
      commission on salaries for elective state officers concerning legislative
      salaries be accepted?  [ ] Yes  [ ] No.&quot;  Such recommendations if approved by
      the electors shall become effective at the beginning of the next regular
      legislative session without any other authorizing legislation.  All
      recommendations which become effective under this section shall supersede all
      laws enacted prior to their effective date relating to such salaries. </P>
