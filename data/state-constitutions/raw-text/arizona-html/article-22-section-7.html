      the records, papers, and proceedings of said district court, and other
      property pertaining thereto, shall pass into the jurisdiction and possession

      belonging to the jurisdiction of said superior court, together with a

      said district courts, and the judges thereof, shall continue with the same
      jurisdiction and powers, to be exercised in the same judicial district,
      respectively, as heretofore, and now, constituted. </P>
