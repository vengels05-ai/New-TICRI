      <P>      </u></font>Section 15.  Monopolies and trusts shall never be allowed in
      this state and no incorporated company, co-partnership  or association of
      persons in this state shall directly or indirectly combine or make any
      contract, with any incorporated company, foreign or domestic, through their
      stockholders or the trustees or assigns of such stockholders or with any
      co-partnership or association of persons, or, in any manner whatever, to fix
      the prices, limit the production, or regulate the transportation of any
      product or commodity.  The legislature shall enact laws for the enforcement of
      this section by adequate penalties, and in the case of incorporated companies,
      if necessary for that purpose, may, as a penalty declare a forfeiture of their
      franchises. </P>
