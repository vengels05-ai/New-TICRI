<p></u></font>Section&nbsp;1. Any amendment or amendments to this constitution may be proposed in either house of the legislature, or by initiative petition signed by a number of qualified electors equal to fifteen percent of the total number of votes for all candidates for governor at the last preceding general election.  Any proposed amendment or amendments which shall be introduced in either house of the legislature, and which shall be approved by a majority of the members elected to each of the two houses, shall be entered on the journal of each house, together with the ayes and nays thereon.  When any proposed amendment or amendments shall be thus passed by a majority of each house of the legislature and entered on the respective journals thereof, or when any elector or electors file with the secretary of state any proposed amendment or amendments together with a petition therefor signed by a number of electors equal to fifteen percent of the total number of votes for all candidates for governor in the last preceding general election, the secretary of state shall submit such proposed amendment or amendments to the vote of the people at the next general election (except when the legislature shall call a special election for the purpose of having said proposed amendment or amendments voted on, in which case the secretary of state shall submit such proposed amendment or amendments to the qualified electors at said special election,) and for any proposed amendment or amendments to approve a tax, if sixty percent of the qualified electors voting thereon shall approve and ratify such proposed amendment or amendments in the regular or special election, such amendment or amendments shall become a part of this constitution and for any other proposed amendment or amendments, if a majority of the qualified electors voting thereon shall approve and ratify such proposed amendment or amendments in the regular or special election, such amendment or amendments shall become a part of this constitution. Until a method of publicity is otherwise provided by law, the secretary of state shall have the proposed amendment or amendments published for a period of at least ninety days before the date of the election in at least one newspaper in every county of the state in which a newspaper is published, in such manner as may be prescribed by law.  If more than one proposed amendment is submitted at any election, the proposed amendments shall be submitted in such a manner that the electors may vote for or against such proposed amendments separately. </p>
