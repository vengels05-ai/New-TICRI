      <P>      Fifth. The lands and other property belonging to citizens of the United
      States residing without this state shall never be taxed at a higher rate than
      the lands and other property situated in this state belonging to residents
      thereof, and no taxes shall be imposed by this state on any lands or other
      property within an Indian reservation owned or held by any Indian; but nothing
      herein shall preclude the state from taxing as other lands and other property
      are taxed, any lands and other property outside of an Indian reservation owned
      or held by any Indian, save and except such lands as have been granted or
      acquired as aforesaid, or as may be granted or confirmed to any Indian or
      Indians under any act of Congress. </P>
