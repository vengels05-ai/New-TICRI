      <P>      </u></font>Section 20.  (1)  The economic estimates commission shall
      determine and publish prior to April 1 of each year the expenditure limitation
      for the following fiscal year for each county, city and town.  The expenditure
      limitations shall be determined by adjusting the amount of actual payments of
      local revenues for each such political subdivision for fiscal year 1979-1980
      to reflect the changes in the population of each political subdivision and the
      cost of living.  The governing board of any political subdivision shall not
      authorize expenditures of local revenues in excess of the limitation
      prescribed in this section, except as provided in subsections (2), (6) and (9)
      of this section.</P>
      <P>      (2)  Expenditures in excess of the limitations determined pursuant to
      subsection (1) of this section may be authorized as follows:</P>
      <P>      (a)  Upon affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members of the governing
      board for expenditures directly necessitated by a natural or man-made disaster
      declared by the governor.  Any expenditures in excess of the expenditure
      limitation, as authorized by this paragraph, shall not affect the
      determination of the expenditure limitation pursuant to subsection (1) of this
      section in any subsequent years.  Any expenditures authorized pursuant to this
      paragraph shall be made either in the fiscal year in which the disaster is
      declared or in the succeeding fiscal year.</P>
      <P>      (b)  Upon the affirmative vote of seventy per cent of the members of the
      governing board for expenditures directly necessitated by a natural or
      man-made disaster not declared by the governor, subject to the following:</P>
      <P>      (i)  The governing board reducing expenditures below the expenditure
      limitation determined pursuant to subsection (1) of this section by the amount
      of the excess expenditure for the fiscal year following a fiscal year in which
      excess expenditures were made pursuant to this paragraph; or</P>
      <P>      (ii)  Approval of the excess expenditure by a majority of the qualified
      electors voting either at a special election held by the governing board or at
      a regularly scheduled election for the nomination or election of the members
      of the governing board, in the manner provided by law.  If the excess
      expenditure is not approved by a majority of the qualified electors voting,
      the governing board shall for the fiscal year which immediately follows the
      fiscal year in which the excess expenditures are made, reduce expenditures
      below the expenditure limitation determined pursuant to subsection (1) of this
      section by the amount of the excess expenditures.  Any expenditures in excess
      of the expenditure limitation, as authorized by this paragraph, shall not
      affect the determination of the expenditure limitation pursuant to subsection
      (1) of this section in any subsequent years.  Any expenditures pursuant to
      this paragraph shall be made either in the fiscal year in which the disaster
      occurs or in the succeeding fiscal year.</P>
      <P>      (c)  Upon affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the members of the
      governing board and approval by a majority of the qualified electors voting
      either at a special election held by the governing board in a manner
      prescribed by law, or at a regularly scheduled election for the nomination or
      election of the members of the governing board.  Such approval by a majority
      of the qualified electors voting shall be for a specific amount in excess of
      the expenditure limitation, and such approval must occur prior to the fiscal
      year in which the expenditure limitation is to be exceeded.  Any expenditures
      in excess of the expenditure limitation, as authorized by this subdivision,
      shall not affect the determination of the expenditure limitation pursuant to
      subsection (1) of this section, in subsequent years.</P>

      <P>      (4)  The economic estimates commission shall adjust the base limit to

      pursuant to subsection (1) of this section beginning with the fiscal year
      immediately following the transfer.</P>
      <P>      (5)  The economic estimates commission shall adjust the base limit to

      fiscal year immediately following the approval, as provided by law.</P>
      <P>      (7)  The legislature shall provide for expenditure limitations for such
      special districts as it deems necessary.</P>
      <P>      (8)  The legislature shall establish by law a uniform reporting system
      for all political subdivisions or special districts subject to an expenditure
      limitation pursuant to this section to insure compliance with this
      section.  The legislature shall establish by law sanctions and penalties for
      failure to comply with this section.</P>
      <P>      (9)  Subsection (1) of this section does not apply to a city or town
      which at a regularly scheduled election for the nomination or election of
      members of the governing board of the city or town adopts an expenditure
      limitation pursuant to this subsection different from the expenditure
      limitation prescribed by subsection (1) of this section.  The governing board
      of a city or town may by a two-thirds vote provide for referral of an
      alternative expenditure limitation or the qualified electors may by
      initiative, in the manner provided by law, propose an alternative expenditure
      limitation.  In a manner provided by law, the impact of the alternative
      expenditure limitation shall be compared to the impact of the expenditure
      limitation prescribed by subsection (1) of this section, and the comparison
      shall appear on the ballot and in publicity pamphlets.  If a majority of the
      qualified electors voting on such issue vote in favor of the alternative
      expenditure limitation, such limitation shall apply to the city or town.  If
      more than one alternative expenditure limitation is on the ballot and more
      than one alternative expenditure limitation is approved by the voters, the
      alternative expenditure limitation receiving the highest number of votes shall
      apply to such city or town.  If an alternative expenditure limitation is
      adopted, it shall apply for the four succeeding fiscal years.  Following the
      fourth succeeding fiscal year, the expenditure limitation prescribed by
      subsection (1) of this section shall become the expenditure limitation for the
      city or town unless an alternative expenditure limitation is approved as
      provided in this subsection.  If a majority of the qualified electors voting
      on such issue vote against an alternative expenditure limitation, the
      expenditure limitation prescribed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section
      shall apply to the city or town, and no new alternative expenditure limitation
      may be submitted to the voters for a period of at least two years.  If an
      alternative expenditure limitation is adopted pursuant to this subsection, the
      city or town may not conduct an override election provided for in section 19,
      subsection (4) of this article, during the time period in which the
      alternative expenditure limitation is in effect.</P>
      <P>      (10)  This section does not apply to any political subdivision until the
      fiscal year immediately following the first regularly scheduled election after
      July 1, 1980 for the nomination or election of the members of the governing
      board of such political subdivision, except that a political subdivision,
      prior to the fiscal year during which the spending limitation would first
      become effective, may modify the expenditure limitation prescribed pursuant to
      subsection (1) of this section, by the provisions prescribed by subsections
      (2) and (6) of this section, or may adopt an alternative expenditure
      limitation pursuant to subsection (9) of this section.</P>
      <P>      A county may conduct a special election to exceed the expenditure
      limitation prescribed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section for the
      fiscal years 1982-1983 and 1983-1984, on the first Tuesday after the first
      Monday in November in 1981.</P>
      <P>      (11)  &quot;City&quot;, as used in this article, means city or charter city. </P>
