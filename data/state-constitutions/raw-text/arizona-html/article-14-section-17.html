                   corporations</P>
      <P>      </u></font>Section 17.  Provision shall be made by law for the payment of a
      fee to the state by every domestic corporation, upon the grant, amendment, or
      extension of its charter, and by every foreign corporation upon its obtaining
      a license to do business in this state; and also for the payment, by every
      domestic corporation and foreign corporation doing business in this state, of
      an annual registration fee of not less than ten dollars, which fee shall be
      paid irrespective of any specific license or other tax imposed by law upon
      such company for the privilege of carrying on its business in this state, or
      upon its franchise or property; and for the making, by every such corporation,
      at the time of paying such fee, of such report to the corporation commission
      of the status, business, or condition of such corporation, as may be
      prescribed by law.  No foreign corporation, except insurers, shall have
      authority to do business in this state, until it shall have obtained from the
      corporation commission a license to do business in the state, upon such terms
      as may be prescribed by law.  The legislature may relieve any purely
      charitable, social, fraternal, benevolent, or religious institution from the
      payment of such annual registration fee. </P>
