      of the State shall have been elected, and qualified, and shall have taken
      office, under this Constitution, the causes then pending in the Supreme Court
      of the Territory, except such causes as would have been within the exclusive

      of the commencement of such causes, and the papers, records, and proceedings
      of said court, and the seal and other property pertaining thereto, shall pass
      into the jurisdiction and possession of the Supreme Court of the State, and
      until so superseded, the Supreme Court of the Territory, and the judges
      thereof, shall continue, with like powers and jurisdiction as if this
      Constitution had not been adopted, or the State admitted into the Union; and
      all causes pending in the Supreme Court of the Territory at said time, and
      which said causes would have been within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
      United States courts, had such courts existed, at the time of the commencement
      of such causes, and the papers, records, and proceedings of said court,
      relating thereto, shall pass into the jurisdiction of the United States
      courts, all as in the Enabling Act approved June 20, 1910, provided. </P>
