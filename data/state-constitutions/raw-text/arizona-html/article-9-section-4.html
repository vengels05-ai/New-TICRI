      July in each year.  An accurate statement of the receipts and expenditures of
      the public money shall be published annually, in such manner as shall be
      provided by law.  Whenever the expenses of any fiscal year shall exceed the
      income, the legislature may provide for levying a tax for the ensuing fiscal
      year sufficient, with other sources of income, to pay the deficiency, as well
      as the estimated expenses of the ensuing fiscal year. </P>
