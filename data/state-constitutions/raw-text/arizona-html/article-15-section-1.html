      <P>      Section 1.  A.  No member of the corporation commission shall hold that
      office for more than two consecutive terms. No corporation commissioner may
      serve again in that office until out of office for one full term. Any person
      who serves one half or more of a term shall be considered to have served one
      term for purposes of this section. </P>
      <P>      B.  A corporation commission is hereby created to be composed of five
      persons who shall be elected at the general election, and whose term of office
      shall be four years, and who shall maintain their chief office at the state
      capital. The two additional commission members shall be elected at the 2002
      general election for initial two-year terms beginning on the first Monday in
      January, 2003. Thereafter, all terms shall be four-year terms. </P>
      <P>      C.  In case of vacancy in the office, the governor shall appoint a
      commissioner to fill the vacancy. The appointed commissioner shall fill the
      vacancy until a commissioner shall be elected at a general election as
      provided by law, and shall qualify. The qualifications of commissioners may be
      prescribed by law.</P>
