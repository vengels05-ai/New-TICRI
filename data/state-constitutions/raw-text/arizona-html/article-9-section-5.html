                  <P> 5.  <font color=PURPLE><u>Power of state to contract debts; purposes;
                  limit; restrictions</P>
      <P>      </u></font>Section 5.  The state may contract debts to supply the casual
      deficits or failures in revenues, or to meet expenses not otherwise provided
      for; but the aggregate amount of such debts, direct and contingent, whether
      contracted by virtue of one or more laws, or at different periods of time,
      shall never exceed the sum of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars; and
      the money arising from the creation of such debts shall be applied to the
      purpose for which it was obtained or to repay the debts so contracted, and to
      no other purpose.</P>
      <P>      In addition to the above limited power to contract debts the state may
      borrow money to repel invasion, suppress insurrection, or defend the state in
      time of war; but the money thus raised shall be applied exclusively to the
      object for which the loan shall have been authorized or to the repayment of
      the debt thereby created.  No money shall be paid out of the state treasury,
      except in the manner provided by law. </P>
