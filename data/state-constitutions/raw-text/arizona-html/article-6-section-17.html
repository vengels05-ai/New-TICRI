      <P>      </u></font>Section 17.  The superior court shall be open at all times,
      except on nonjudicial days, for the determination of non-jury civil cases and
      the transaction of business.  For the determination of civil causes and
      matters in which a jury demand has been entered, and for the trial of criminal
      causes, a trial jury shall be drawn and summoned from the body of the county,
      as provided by law.  The right of jury trial as provided by this constitution
      shall remain inviolate, but trial by jury may be waived by the parties in any
      civil cause or by the parties with the consent of the court in any criminal
      cause.  Grand juries shall be drawn and summoned only by order of the superior
      court. </P>
