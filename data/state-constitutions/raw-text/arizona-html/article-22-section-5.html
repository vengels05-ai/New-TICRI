      <P>      </u></font>Section 5.  All criminal prosecutions and penal actions which
      may have arisen, or which may arise, before the change from a Territorial to a
      State government, and which shall then be pending, shall be prosecuted to
      judgment and execution in the name of the State.  All offenses committed
      against the laws of the Territory of Arizona before the change from a
      Territorial to a State government, and which shall not be prosecuted before
      such change, may be prosecuted in the name, and by the authority, of the State
      of Arizona, with like effect as though such change had not taken place, and
      all penalties incurred and punishments inflicted shall remain the same as if
      this Constitution had not been adopted.  All actions at law and suits in
      equity, which may be pending in any of the courts, of the Territory of Arizona
      at the time of the change from a Territorial to a State government, shall be
      continued and transferred to the court of the State, or of the United States,
      having jurisdiction thereof. </P>
