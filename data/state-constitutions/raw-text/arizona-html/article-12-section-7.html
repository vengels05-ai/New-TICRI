                  <P> 7.  <font color=PURPLE><u>County charter provisions</P>
      <P>      </u></font>Section 7.  A.  Charter counties continue to be political
      subdivisions of this state that exist to aid in the administration of this
      state's laws and for purposes of self-government.  Except as otherwise
      provided in this article the powers of the legislature over counties are not
      affected by this section and sections 5, 6, 8 and 9 of this article.  Charter
      counties shall provide the same state mandated services and perform the same
      state mandated functions as non-charter counties.  Charter counties may
      exercise, if provided by the charter, all powers over local concerns of the
      county consistent with, and subject to, the constitution and the laws of this
      state.  In matters of strictly local municipal concern, charters adopted
      pursuant to article XIII shall control in any case of conflict with a county
      charter adopted pursuant to this article.</P>
      <P>      B.  If a county has framed and adopted a charter and the charter is
      approved by the governor as provided in this article, the county shall be
      governed by the terms of its charter and ordinances passed pursuant to its
      charter.  If the charter has been framed, adopted and approved and any of its
      provisions are in conflict with any county ordinance, rule or regulation
      relating to local concerns of the counties in force at the time of the
      adoption and approval of the charter, the provisions of the charter prevail
      notwithstanding the conflict and operate as a repeal or suspension of the law
      to the extent of conflict, and the law is not thereafter operative as to such
      conflict.</P>
      <P>      C.  Notwithstanding article IX, section 1, if proposed and approved in
      the charter, a charter county may levy and collect:</P>
      <P>      1.  Taxes on a countywide basis to provide services on a countywide
      basis.</P>
      <P>      2.  Taxes on a specially designated area basis to provide services or
      special levels of service to that area.</P>
      <P>      All taxes levied pursuant to this subsection shall be uniform upon the
      same class of property within the territorial limits of the county or the
      specially designated area and shall be levied and collected for public
      purposes only.</P>
      <P>      D.  The decision to include a charter provision authorizing taxation
      pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 1 or 2 of this section shall be placed on
      the ballot as separate questions at the election to ratify the charter and
      must be approved by a majority of the qualified electors voting at the
      election.  The result of the voting on either provision authorizing taxation
      does not affect the result of the voting to ratify the charter.  Charter
      provisions authorizing taxation pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 1 or 2 of
      this section may also be proposed by an amendment to the charter pursuant to
      section 6 of this article.</P>
      <P>      E.  If the authority to tax pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 2 of
      this section is approved for inclusion in the charter, any new tax proposed by
      the county under subsection C, paragraph 2 of this section shall be voted on
      by the qualified electors of the specially designated area.  The tax must be
      ratified by a majority vote of the qualified electors voting at the election.</P>
      <P>      F.  A transaction privilege tax, use tax or similar tax levied by a
      county pursuant to subsection C, paragraph 1 of this section:</P>
      <P>      1.  May be imposed on only those business activities, or on the use,
      storage or consumption, which are subject to the comparable state transaction
      privilege tax, use tax or similar tax.</P>
      <P>      2.  Shall provide all exclusion and exemptions provided by, and
      administrative provisions consistent with, the comparable state transaction
      privilege tax, use tax or similar tax.</P>
      <P>      G.  All taxes levied under subsection F of this section shall not exceed
      an aggregate rate of two per cent when combined with existing taxes levied
      pursuant to title 42, chapter 8.3.</P>
      <P>      H.  If approved in the charter, a charter county may adopt fees and fee
      schedules for any county products and county service delivery it provides in
      the conduct of any official business.  Notwithstanding any fee schedules or
      individual charges provided by state law, the governing body of a charter
      county may adopt an alternate fee schedule or individual charge.  Any fee or
      charge established pursuant to this section shall be attributable to and
      defray or cover the current or future costs of the product or service delivery
      for which the fee or charge is assessed.</P>
      <P>      I.  Taxes raised under the authority of this section shall be subject to
      the provisions of the county property tax and expenditure limitations pursuant
      to article IX, sections 19 and 20. </P>
