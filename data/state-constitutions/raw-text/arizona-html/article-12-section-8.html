      <P>      </u></font>Section 8.  A.  The county charter shall provide:</P>
      <P>      1.  For an elective governing body and its method of compensation, its
      powers, duties and responsibilities, its authority to delegate powers, the
      method of election and removal of members, the terms of office and the manner
      of filling vacancies in the governing body.</P>
      <P>      2.  For all officers established under section 3 of this article and
      article VI, section 23, and such additional officers as the charter may
      provide for, their election or appointment, consolidation or segregation,
      method of compensation, powers, duties and responsibilities, authority to
      delegate powers and, if elected, the method of election and removal, terms of
      office and the manner of filling vacancies in such offices.  If the charter
      provides for the attorney to remain an elective officer of the county, the
      charter may provide for an appointive office to carry out the civil
      representation needs of the county, its departments, agencies, boards,
      commissions, officials and employees.  If the elective governing body provided
      for in the charter does not consist of supervisors, the charter may provide
      for elimination of the office of supervisor.  If the charter provides for the
      office of supervisor, the number of supervisors shall be not fewer than five
      or greater than nine.  If the charter provides for the appointment or
      elimination of an officer established under section 3 of this article or
      article VI, section 23, or for an appointive office to carry out the civil
      representation needs of the county, those provisions shall include an
      effective date not earlier than the expiration of the term of office for the
      officer commencing in January immediately following the first general election
      at which the officer is elected following approval of the charter by the
      voters and shall be placed on the ballot as separate questions at the election
      to ratify the charter and must be approved by a majority of the qualified
      electors voting at the election.  The result of the voting on any provisions
      authorizing appointment or elimination of officers does not affect the result
      of the voting to ratify the charter.</P>
      <P>      3.  For the performance of functions required by statute.</P>
      <P>      4.  For a periodic review of the charter provisions to be conducted at
      least once every ten years from the time of its ratification by the voters and
      the procedures for the periodic review.</P>
      <P>      B.  The county charter may provide for other elective and appointive
      offices. </P>
