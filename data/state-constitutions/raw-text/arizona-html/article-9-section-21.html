                  community college districts</P>
      <P>      </u></font>Section 21.  (1)  The economic estimates commission shall
      determine and publish prior to April 1 of each year the expenditure limitation
      for the following fiscal year for each community college district.  The
      expenditure limitations shall be determined by adjusting the amount of
      expenditures of local revenues for each such district for fiscal year
      1979-1980 to reflect the changes in the student population of each district
      and the cost of living.  The governing board of any community college district
      shall not authorize expenditures of local revenues in excess of the limitation
      prescribed in this section, except in the manner provided by law.</P>
      <P>      (2)  The economic estimates commission shall determine and publish prior
      to May 1 of each year the aggregate expenditure limitation for all school
      districts for the following fiscal year. The aggregate expenditure limitation
      shall be determined by adjusting the total amount of expenditures of local
      revenues for all school districts for fiscal year 1979-1980 to reflect the
      changes in student population in the school districts and the cost of living,
      and multiplying the result by 1.10.  The aggregate expenditures of local
      revenues for all school districts shall not exceed the limitation prescribed
      in this section, except as provided in subsection (3) of this section.</P>
      <P>      (3)  Expenditures in excess of the limitation determined pursuant to
      subsection (2) of this section may be authorized by the legislature for a
      single fiscal year, by concurrent resolution, upon affirmative vote of
      two-thirds of the membership of each house of the legislature.</P>

      <P>      (ii)  A different measure or index of the cost of living adopted at the
      direction of the legislature, by concurrent resolution, upon affirmative vote
      of two-thirds of the membership of each house of the legislature.  Such
      measure or index shall apply for subsequent fiscal years, except it shall not

      the measure or index is adopted after March 1 of the preceding fiscal year.</P>
