      <P>      </u></font>Section 12.  The liberty of conscience secured by the provisions
      of this constitution shall not be so construed as to excuse acts of
      licentiousness, or justify practices inconsistent with the peace and safety of
      the state.  No public money or property shall be appropriated for or applied
      to any religious worship, exercise, or instruction, or to the support of any
      religious establishment.  No religious qualification shall be required for any
      public office or employment, nor shall any person be incompetent as a witness
      or juror in consequence of his opinion on matters of religion, nor be
      questioned touching his religious belief in any court of justice to affect the
      weight of his testimony.</P>
