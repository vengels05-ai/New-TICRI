      state educational institutions shall be derived from the investment of the
      proceeds of the sale, and from the rental of such lands as have been set aside
      by the enabling act approved June 20, 1910, or other legislative enactment of
      the United States, for the use and benefit of the respective state educational
      institutions. In addition to such income the legislature shall make such

      of all state educational institutions, and shall make such special
      appropriations as shall provide for their development and improvement. </P>
